Text-to-Image Generation using Stable Diffusion

Overview This project demonstrates the generation of images from textual descriptions using the Stable Diffusion model, a state-of-the-art generative model. By providing a textual prompt, the model generates visually compelling images that correspond to the given description.

Requirements Python 3.x PyTorch Transformers Diffusers Gradio

Configuration

The configuration parameters can be adjusted in the config.py file to modify the image generation process, such as the number of inference steps and the model architecture. Credits This project utilizes the Stable Diffusion model and other libraries such as PyTorch, Transformers, and Diffusers.
